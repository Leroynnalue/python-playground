Basically a **List** is a collection of values(same or different type).

- A collection allows you to store many values in one variable

## Iterating through a list
---
- Using A Definite Loop

```
list = [1,2,3,4,5]

for index in list:
    print(index)
print("Done")

```


## Looking Inside Lists
---
Just like strings, we can get at any single element in a list using an index(in other words subscript) specified in square brackets.

```
list = [1,2,3,4,5]
print("Item One:"list[0])

```

## Key Values
---
- Lists are mutable unlike strings
